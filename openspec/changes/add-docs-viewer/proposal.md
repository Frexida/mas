# Add Documentation Viewer to Web UI

## Summary
Add a documentation viewer feature to the existing web UI that allows users to browse and read OpenSpec documents generated by each agent unit directly from the browser interface.

## Problem Statement
Currently, OpenSpec documents generated by 13 AI agents across different units are scattered in separate directories (`unit/XX/openspec/`), making it difficult to:
- Browse and navigate documentation across all units
- Quickly access specific agent's specifications and proposals
- Get an overview of the entire system's documentation
- View documents without accessing the file system directly

## Proposed Solution
Implement a minimal, functional documentation viewer integrated into the existing web UI with:
1. A hierarchical tree view for navigating unit/agent structure
2. A document viewer for rendering markdown content
3. API endpoints to serve OpenSpec documents
4. Simple navigation between session view and documentation view

## Success Criteria
- Users can browse all OpenSpec documents through the web interface
- Navigation is intuitive with a clear hierarchy (Units → Agents → Documents)
- Documents are rendered with proper markdown formatting
- The viewer integrates seamlessly with the existing session management UI
- No external dependencies beyond what's already in the project

## Scope
### In Scope
- API endpoint for serving OpenSpec documents (`/api/docs`)
- Tree view component for unit/agent navigation
- Document viewer component with markdown rendering
- Integration with existing web UI navigation
- Support for all 13 agents across 4 units

### Out of Scope
- Document editing capabilities
- Real-time synchronization
- Search functionality (can be added later)
- Version control or history viewing
- Document generation or processing

## Dependencies
- Existing: React, React Router, React Markdown (already in package.json)
- Existing: Hono API framework
- No new dependencies required

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Large documents might impact performance
  - **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading and pagination if needed
- **Risk**: Missing or malformed OpenSpec directories
  - **Mitigation**: Graceful error handling with empty state messages

## Timeline
This is a focused feature that can be completed in a single development session:
1. API implementation: 30 minutes
2. UI components: 1-2 hours
3. Integration and testing: 30 minutes
